export const HERO_CONTENT = `I worked as a web developer, mainly focusing on backend development using Laravel for over 2 years. Recently, I started learning the MERN stack to transition into a full-stack developer. This change reflects my enthusiasm for tackling new challenges and keeping up with industry advancements.

During my time in backend development, I specialized in technologies like Laravel, PHP, and MySQL, where I built efficient and secure web applications. Now, as I delve into frontend technologies such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js, I aim to create dynamic and scalable full-stack projects.

I am currently seeking opportunities in full-stack development roles to utilize my extensive backend experience and emerging frontend skills in crafting innovative and impactful web solutions.`;
